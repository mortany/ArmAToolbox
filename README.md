Release 4.0.5 has been updated. If you had trouble installing it, it should work now. Turns out I forgot to add the distribution archive :|

# ArmAToolbox
Arma Toolbox for Blender
This is a collection of Python scripts for the Blender 3D package
that allows the user to create, import and export unbinarized 
Arma Engine .p3d files. 

# Before reporting bugs...
... please read the <a href="https://github.com/AlwarrenSidh/ArmAToolbox/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions">FAQ</a>
Also, "it doesn't work" isn't a bug report. At the very least, mention the version of blender you are using, the version of the toolbox, and any error messages. Due to the way that Blender reports error messages (i.e. not good) you might have missed it. Go to "Windows -> System Console" and check there for any errors.
